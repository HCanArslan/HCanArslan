I build things that carry weight.

Not products. Not features. *Presence.*

The kind of work that doesn't explain itself because it doesn't need to. Code that breathes. Interfaces that feel like they were always supposed to exist. Systems that make sense until they shouldn't — and then evolve.

### `philosophy.config`

```javascript
const approach = {
  foundation: "logic + science",
  constraint: "never caged by either",
  meaning: "constructed, not given",
  authenticity: "discipline, not trend",
  goal: "resonance over recognition"
};
```

<br>

I respect systems.  
Until they stop making sense.  
Then I build better ones.

### `current_signal`

```
████████████████████████████████░░░░░░  calibrating...
```

<br>

Building in the space between **structure** and **rebellion**.

Focused on work that's slightly dark, slightly futuristic, deeply human.  
Not chasing validation. Chasing frequency.
